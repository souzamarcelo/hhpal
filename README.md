# HHPAL
**Hybrid heuristic for unconstrained binary qudratic programming trained on Palubeckis' instances**

This heuristic algorithm was automatically generated using the [AutoBQP](https://github.com/souzamarcelo/AutoBQP) solver. The automated algorithm design process and the HHPAL algorithm are detailed in the following article (see AAC_P algorithm).
